    <section id="introduction">
        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>EZCode is a high-level scripting language designed to be as simple and easy to understand as possible. It aims to make programming accessible to everyone, with an intuitive syntax that is readable and straightforward. This makes it perfect for beginners and non-programmers, while still being powerful enough to create complex applications, games, and more.</p>

    <section id="file-format">
        <h2>2. File Format</h2>
        <p><strong>File Extension:</strong> .ez</p>
        <p><strong>Example File:</strong> game.ez</p>
        <p>EZCode files are plain text files that can be opened and edited with any text editor, such as Notepad or Visual Studio Code.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="basic-syntax">
        <h2>3. Basic Syntax</h2>

        <h3>3.1. Statements and Commands</h3>
        <p>All commands are written in plain English. No semicolons or complex punctuation are needed (just simple line breaks between statements).</p>
        <pre>
create object at 100, 200
move object right by 10
        </pre>

        <h3>3.2. Variables</h3>
        <p>EZCode allows the use of variables to store and manipulate data.</p>
        <pre>
set player_health to 100
set player_name to "Hero"
        </pre>

        <h3>3.3. Functions</h3>
        <p>EZCode supports defining functions that allow for code reuse.</p>
        <pre>
function say_hello
    print "Hello, World!"
end function

call say_hello
        </pre>

        <h3>3.4. Comments</h3>
        <p>To make your code more readable, you can add comments. Comments are ignored by the interpreter and are for human readers only.</p>
        <pre>
// This is a comment
set player_health to 100 // Setting initial health
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section id="control-flow">
        <h2>4. Control Flow</h2>

else

end if
        </pre>

        <h3>4.2. Loops</h3>
        <p><strong>For Loop:</strong></p>
        <pre>
for i from 1 to 10
    print i
end for
        </pre>

        <p><strong>Repeat Forever Loop:</strong></p>
        <pre>
repeat forever
    move player up by 5
end repeat
        </pre>
